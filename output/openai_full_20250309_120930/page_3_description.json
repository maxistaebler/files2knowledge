  "description": "\nThe slide is titled \"Training Process\" in bold white letters on a black background. Below the title, there are three bullet points with accompanying images and descriptions:\n\n1. The first bullet point states, \"Get sequence of text from training data, split into input and output tokens.\" This is accompanied by an image showing a colorful string of text with different colors representing different tokens.\n2. The second bullet point reads, \"Have model make prediction based on input sequence.\" This is depicted with an image of the same colorful string of text, now with a highlighted section indicating where the model would make its prediction.\n3. The third bullet point says, \"Compare model output to actual output ('cat' vs. 'dog') to get error value.\" This is illustrated by the same image with a highlighted section that shows the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.\n4. The fourth bullet point states, \"Back propagation: run the model in reverse, adjusting weights based on error value.\" This is represented by an image of the same string of text with a highlighted section indicating where the backpropagation would occur.\n5. The fifth bullet point reads, \"Repeat many many times.\" This is depicted with an image of the same string of text, now with multiple highlights indicating repeated iterations of the training process."
