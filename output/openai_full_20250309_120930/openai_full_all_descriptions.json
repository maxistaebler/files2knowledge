    "2": "\nThis is some text that has been divided into tokens using OpenAI's tokenization algorithm for GPT-4",
    "3": "\nThe slide is titled \"Training Process\" in bold white letters on a black background. Below the title, there are three bullet points with accompanying images and descriptions:\n\n1. The first bullet point states, \"Get sequence of text from training data, split into input and output tokens.\" This is accompanied by an image showing a colorful string of text with different colors representing different tokens.\n2. The second bullet point reads, \"Have model make prediction based on input sequence.\" This is depicted with an image of the same colorful string of text, now with a highlighted section indicating where the model would make its prediction.\n3. The third bullet point says, \"Compare model output to actual output ('cat' vs. 'dog') to get error value.\" This is illustrated by the same image with a highlighted section that shows the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.\n4. The fourth bullet point states, \"Back propagation: run the model in reverse, adjusting weights based on error value.\" This is represented by an image of the same string of text with a highlighted section indicating where the backpropagation would occur.\n5. The fifth bullet point reads, \"Repeat many many times.\" This is depicted with an image of the same string of text, now with multiple highlights indicating repeated iterations of the training process.",
    "4": "\nThe slide is titled \"Generating Output\" and appears to be a flowchart illustrating a process in a programming context. The flowchart consists of four main steps: Tokenize Input Sequence, Predict Next Token, Append Output Token to Input Sequence, and Stop Token Received? If the answer is No, the process loops back to Tokenize Input Sequence. If the answer is Yes, the process concludes with \"Generation Finished.\"\n\nThe first step involves tokenizing the input sequence, which means breaking down the input into smaller units called tokens. The second step predicts the next token in the sequence based on the current context. The third step appends the output token to the input sequence, effectively adding it to the end of the sequence. The fourth and final step is a decision point that checks if the token received is the last token in the sequence. If not, the process loops back to the first step for further processing. If the token received is the last token, the process concludes with \"Generation Finished.\"\n\nThe flowchart uses simple text labels and arrows to indicate the direction of the process. There are no graphical elements or icons present in the slide. The background of the slide is black, which contrasts with the white text and arrows, making it easy to read and understand."
