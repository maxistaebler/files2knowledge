    "3": "\nThe slide is titled \"Training Process\" in bold white letters on a black background. Below the title, there are three bullet points with accompanying images and descriptions:\n\n1. The first bullet point states, \"Get sequence of text from training data, split into input and output tokens.\" This suggests that the process involves extracting sequences of text from a dataset used for training, which is then divided into two parts: input and output tokens.\n\n2. The second bullet point reads, \"Have model make prediction based on input sequence.\" This implies that after splitting the data, a model is used to predict something based on the input sequence.\n\n3. The third bullet point says, \"Compare model output to actual output ('cat' vs. 'dog') to get error value.\" This indicates that the predicted output from the model is compared to the actual output, which in this case is 'cat' versus 'dog', to determine an error value.\n\n4. The fourth bullet point concludes with \"Back propagation: run the model in reverse, adjusting weights based on error value.\" This suggests that after obtaining the error value, the model's weights are adjusted in a backward manner to improve future predictions.\n\n5. The final bullet point states, \"Repeat many many times.\" This implies that the process of training and backpropagation is repeated multiple times to refine the model's performance.\n\nThe slide also contains an image at the bottom with a colorful sequence of words: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat,\" which seems to be an example of input data for the model.",
    "4": "\nThe slide is titled \"Generating Output\" and appears to be a flowchart illustrating a process in a programming context. The flowchart consists of four main steps: Tokenize Input Sequence, Predict Next Token, Append Output Token to Input Sequence, and Stop Token Received? If the answer is No, it loops back to Tokenize Input Sequence. If the answer is Yes, it proceeds to Generation Finished.\n\nThe first step involves tokenizing the input sequence, which means breaking down the input into smaller units called tokens. The second step predicts the next token in the sequence based on the current state of the sequence and any patterns or rules that have been established. If a token is received, it is appended to the end of the input sequence. If no token is received, the process loops back to the first step.\n\nThe final step indicates that the generation process has finished. The flowchart uses a diamond shape to represent the decision point where the next token is predicted or not received. The arrows between the steps indicate the direction of the process flow. There are no additional graphics, charts, or figures in the slide."
